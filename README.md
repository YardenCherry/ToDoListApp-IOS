# ToDoList iOS App

ToDoList is an iOS application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can register, login, add tasks, and delete tasks. The app uses Firebase for authentication, database, and storage, and utilizes Shared Preferences for storing user data locally.

## Features

- User Registration
- User Login
- Add Task
- Delete Task
- Side Menu with User Profile and Logout Button

## Firebase Integration

This app uses Firebase for the following functionalities:

### Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used for user registration and login.

### Realtime Database

Firebase Realtime Database is used to store user data, including tasks.

### Storage

Firebase Storage is used to store user profile pictures.

## Shared Preferences

Shared Preferences are used to store user data locally on the device, providing a faster way to access user information without always querying the database.
